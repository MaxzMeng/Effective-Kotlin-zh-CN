# Chapter 6: Class design

Classes are the most important abstraction in the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. Since OOP is the most popular paradigm in Kotlin, classes are very important for us as well. This chapter is about class design. Not about system design, since it would require much more space and there are already many great books on this topic such as Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin or Design Patterns by Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, and Richard Helm. Instead, we will mainly talk about contracts that Kotlin classes are expected to fulfill - how we use Kotlin structures and what is expected from us when we use them. When and how should we use inheritance? How do we expect data classes to be used? When should we use function types instead of interfaces with a single method? What are the contracts of `equals`, `hashCode` and `compareTo`? When should we use extensions instead of members? These are the kind of questions we will answer here. They are all important because breaking them might cause serious problems, and following them will help you make your code safer and cleaner.
